💳 Java Bank Account Simulation Mini-Project
This mini-project showcases core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java through a simple bank account simulation. It demonstrates how real-world banking operations like deposits and withdrawals can be modeled using Java classes and business logic.

🔍 Concepts Covered
✅ Constructors for object creation and initialization
✅ this keyword to reference the current instance and avoid naming conflicts
✅ Static variables & methods to maintain shared class-level data (e.g., bank name)
✅ Encapsulation by restricting direct access to class fields
✅ Basic business logic for deposits, withdrawals, and balance management
✅ Output formatting & feedback through simple print statements
